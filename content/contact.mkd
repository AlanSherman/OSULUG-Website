We keep in touch via our [mailing list][ml], and in the `#osu-lug` irc channel on `irc.freenode.net`. For more info about irc, check out [this guide][ircguide] by our own Emily Dunham.

Feel free to subscribe to the mailing list or hang out in the irc channel, even if you aren't a member. We are a generally helpful and friendly group.
